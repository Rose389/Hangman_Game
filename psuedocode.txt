HANGMAN

the Obective:
	to guess a random word, one letter at a time, with a limited number of guesses.

The Setup:
	the computer chooses a word, and displays an _ for each letter in the word.

The Rules:
	*player guesses a letter
	*if it is correct, computer fills in the corresponding _(s)
	*if it is incorrect, the computer places the letter below the board and decreases the guesses remaining by one.

How to win:
	the player must fill in all the _ with the correct letters within the timeframe/#of guesses.


Coding the game:

*I need an array of words the computer can choose.
*I need code to 'get' a random word from the list
* I need the computer to count the number of letters in the word chosen and put that many _ on the board.
*I need a counter for wins
* I need a counter for losses
* I need an event listener to know which letter the player typed.
* I need cod3e to clear the board and choose another word.
* this sounds like a series of if else statements within a loop or two.
